# What is this?
Using the work of Significant-Gravitas [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) we will attempt to build a plugin generator that makes gpt-4 plugins for you based on natural language prompts and specifications.

# How does it work?
We will use the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference) to generate the plugins. These plugins will match a users requests and specifications. The user will be able to specify the plugin name, description, and other details. The user will also be able to specify the plugin's functionality, and the plugin will be generated based on the user's desired use-case.

# How do I use it?
You can use this plugin generator by running the `main.py` file. This will start the plugin generator and allow you to specify the plugin's details and functionality.

# How do I contribute?
You can contribute to this project by forking the repository and making a pull request. You can also open an issue if you find a bug or have a feature request.

# How do I get help?
Open an issue on the repository and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
