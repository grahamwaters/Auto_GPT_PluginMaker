# Findings Folder Structure

The files in this folder are generated by the `agent_engine.py` file as the agent parses the internet for answers and learns about how to solve the problem. The files are generated in the following structure:

```

The bot learns and assimiates information from the internet and stores it in the `findings/` folder. The `findings/` folder is organized by session, and each session has a `session_X_findings.json` file that contains the findings from that session. The `findings/` folder also contains a `README.md` file that contains a summary of the findings from all sessions.
