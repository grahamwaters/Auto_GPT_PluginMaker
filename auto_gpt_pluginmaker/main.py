"""
In this code:

We're defining a FastAPI application with app = FastAPI().
We're defining a SearchQuery model that represents a search query. It has one field, query, which is a string.
We're defining a SearchResult model that represents a search result. It has three fields: title, url, and snippet, all of which are strings.
We're defining a /search endpoint that accepts POST requests. It expects a SearchQuery in the request body and returns a list of SearchResults.
The search function is where you would implement your search logic. You would take the query from the request, perform the search on the various websites and databases, and return the results.
